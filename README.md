# Discord-Presence-Simulator
Simulates Discord Presence

DPS will simulate to discord that you're playing a game, but one of which you yourself have set up.
It can be literally anything.

In order to use DPS, you just first create an application by pressing the "Create Presence" button in DPS.
Once you've done that, the rest of the setup should be easy.

I've tried to make DPS as user friendly as possible, but it still requires a little bit of knowledge.
